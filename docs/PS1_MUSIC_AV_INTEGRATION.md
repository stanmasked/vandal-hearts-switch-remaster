# PS1 SEQ/VAB + native Switch graphics integration

This feature branch combines two previously separate, tested prototypes:
the libnx 1280x720 tactical-grid framebuffer and the native PS1-format
SEQ/VAB/SPU music pipeline. It is not yet the original playable game.

## Startup and content policy

The NRO attempts to load exactly three **user-owned** files from
`sdmc:/switch/vandal-hearts-remake/audio/`: `music.seq`, `music.vh`,
and `music.vb`. The complete file set is validated and decoded before
the sound worker starts. No copyrighted music is embedded in the binary
or GitHub. The files are neither uploaded nor modified.

If all three files are missing, the NRO uses a generated SEQ/VAB/VAG
fixture, allowing CI to run without any proprietary material. A partial
or malformed set fails closed: the audio status is red, rather than
silently playing the fixture as if the owned tracks had loaded.

The main thread handles the gamepad, simple tactical demonstration and
framebuffer. A separate libnx thread generates 512 frames of 44.1kHz
SPU stereo PCM per music block, applies Gaussian interpolation and
the existing STUDIO_C reverb path, then resamples to 48kHz for `audout`.
Every call supplies at most 640 stereo output frames in a fully allocated
4KiB-aligned audio page. Music banks are released **after** the sound
thread is joined and the audio service is stopped.

## Display indicators and limitations

The upper-right green status means audout startup returned successfully
and no synchronous worker error has been recorded; red indicates failure
or device unavailability. A small marker just below status is green for
the user-owned audio set and gray for the generated fixture. Neither
indicator confirms that music was audible to a listener.

The animated blue heartbeat and tactical-grid marker support an
independent emulator screenshot check of ongoing framebuffer updates.
Audio timing, fidelity of VAB mappings, audible playback on physical
Switch hardware and integration with original Vandal Hearts gameplay
are not established by a successful synthetic CI run.

## Building and regression tests

From this feature branch, with devkitPro/libnx installed:

```sh
make test-audio-stream
make ps1-music-av-probe
```

The `native-ps1-music-av.yml` GitHub Actions workflow also runs a
UBSan-checked long-duration synthetic SEQ/SPU/reverb/resampler soak,
builds the NRO without SDL2/pacman downloads, and exercises the
framebuffer in NeXium. All CI tests use synthetic audio assets.
Full Switch functionality still requires local hardware validation.
